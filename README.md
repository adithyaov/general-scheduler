# Concept of the Project  
We know that Scheduling is a NP-hard problem. Our aim is to convert the scheduling problem into a SAT problem to use the Z3 SMT solver. We have to find out a way to set up a query language which a client can use to define their problem which should be converted to a SAT problem.

# INSTALLING Z3

Contact Mayank if any problem occurs during installation

step 01: `mkdir -p ~\gen_scheduler; cd ~\gen_scheduler`
step 02: `git clone https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3.git`
step 03: `cd z3`
step 04: `python scripts/mk_make.py`
step 05: `cd build`
step 06: `make`
step 07: `sudo make install`
step 08: `cd ~`
step 09: `cp .bashrc .bashrc_bkp`
step 10: `echo "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/inf/apps/z3/build" >> .bashrc`
step 11: `echo "export PYTHONPATH=/home/inf/apps/z3/build/python" >> .bashrc`
step 12: `source .bashrc`
