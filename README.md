# Concept of the Project  
We know that Scheduling is a NP-hard problem. Our aim is to convert the scheduling problem into a SAT problem to use the Z3 SMT solver. We have to find out a way to set up a query language which a client can use to define their problem which should be converted to a SAT problem.
